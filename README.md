# Simple Order System for PHP

## Overview
Simple Login for PHP does pretty much what it says: it's a lightweight order system for ordering products. It's going to be used for trade accounts where it will generate pro-formas, then invoices as required, and more stuff that I've not decided yet.

The aim of this project is to keep things as customisable as possible, in that there is (and will be) no templating system or complex frontend design, and should be easily integrated into an existing site.

User messages, error messages, etc. are all configured in private/config.php.

## Requirements
This should work on PHP 5+.

## Licence
The entire contents of this repository is licenced under the GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v3 unless otherwise specified. Basically you can use this for whatever purposes you would like to as long as you credit the work to me (generally a little note somewhere readable referencing `Elliot J. Reed, www.cyanidesystems.com` will do). Should you make any changes you must publish these in a prominent place such as GitHub, Sourceforge, etc. It would also be nice, though not required, if you were to let me know of any changes, as I may have missed something and could use the changes / edits myself.
